# Code Aggregator

## Introduction

Code Aggregator is a Python tool designed to efficiently compile code from specified directories and file types into a single file. This utility is ideal for developers looking to analyze or review their codebase with AI tools or for any scenario requiring a consolidated view of code across multiple files.

## Features

- **Custom Directory and File Type Selection**: Tailor your search to include only the directories and file types you deem relevant, avoiding unnecessary clutter.
- **Optimized for AI Analysis**: By aggregating code into one file, this tool simplifies the process of feeding code into AI for analysis, making it a valuable asset for developers seeking insights or verification.
- **Flexibility**: Whether you're working within a specific framework or across diverse languages, set your desired extensions and directories to focus on what truly matters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system by running: `python --version`

### Usage

1. **Configure the Script**: Edit the script to specify the folders and file extensions you want to include in the aggregation. This step is crucial for tailoring the tool to your specific needs.
2. **Run the Aggregator**: Execute the script. It will search the designated directories for files matching your criteria and compile their contents into a single, easily accessible file.
3. **Review and Analyze**: With your code in one place, analyzing your work with AI or other tools becomes significantly more straightforward, saving you valuable time and effort.

## Conclusion

The Code Aggregator is more than just a utility; it's a workflow enhancer for developers looking to streamline their code review and analysis processes. By providing a simple yet flexible way to consolidate code, it enables more effective interaction with AI tools and facilitates a deeper understanding of your codebase.
