# Code Aggregator

## Introduction

The Code Aggregator is a Python tool for developers to efficiently compile code from specified directories and file types into a single file. This utility stands out by not only aggregating code but also by prefixing each section with the file's path and name, providing clear context for each piece of code. This feature is particularly useful for AI analysis, where understanding the structure and organization of a codebase can greatly enhance the insights provided.

## Features

- **Contextual Aggregation**: Automatically prefixes each code section with its file path and name, offering context and making it easier for AI tools to grasp the structure of your codebase.
- **Custom Directory and File Type Selection**: Tailors searches to only include the directories and file types you find relevant, ensuring a focused and clutter-free aggregation.
- **Optimized for AI Analysis**: Simplifies the process of feeding code into AI for comprehensive analysis, making this tool indispensable for developers seeking deeper insights or validation of their code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system by checking with: `python --version`

### Usage

1. **Configure the Script**: Modify the script settings to specify the folders and file extensions you wish to aggregate. This customization is key to making the tool fit your unique requirements.
2. **Run the Aggregator**: Launch the script to commence the search through your designated directories, compiling files that match your specified criteria into a single document, complete with informative headers for each file.
3. **Engage in Analysis**: With your entire codebase presented in a single .txt file (defaults to 'current-code.txt'), augmented by the context of file paths and names, engaging with AI tools for code analysis becomes a more intuitive and effective process.


### Conclusion

- **It is a simple utility** that compiles all your essential code into one place, ready for cut-and-paste into an AI analysis request. It's designed to save you time while helping to manage rate limits effectively.
